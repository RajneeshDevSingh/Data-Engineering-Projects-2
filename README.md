## 🧾 Executive Summary (For Hiring Managers)

- ✅ **Pipeline scope**: Built a complete ETL pipeline from raw CSVs to star schema warehouse to analytical marts  
- ✅ **Data modeling**: Designed a star schema with fact tables, dimensions, and bridge tables for many-to-many relationships  
- ✅ **ETL development**: Implemented extract, transform, load processes with idempotent operations and data quality checks  
- ✅ **Mart architecture**: Created specialized data marts (flat, skills, priority) with additive measures and incremental update patterns

## 🧩 Problem & Context

Raw job posting data arrives as flat CSV files in Google Cloud Storage—not structured for analytical queries. Analysts need to answer:

- Which skills are most in-demand over time?  
- What are hiring trends by company and location?  
- How do salary patterns vary by role and skill?  

**Challenge**: Data teams need a single source of truth system—a data warehouse—to enable consistent, reliable analysis across the organization. Additionally, specialized data marts are required to optimize resources by pre-aggregating data for specific business use cases, reducing query complexity and improving performance for common analytical patterns.

**Solution**: End-to-end ETL pipeline that extracts CSVs from cloud storage, normalizes them into a star schema warehouse (separating facts from dimensions), and creates specialized data marts optimized for specific use cases (flat queries, skill demand analysis, priority role tracking).

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- 🐤 **Database**: DuckDB (file-based OLAP database with GCS integration via httpfs)  
- 🧮 **Language**: SQL (DDL for schema design, DML for data loading and transformation)  
- 📊 **Data Model**: Star schema (fact + dimension + bridge tables)  
- 🛠️ **Development**: VS Code for SQL editing + Terminal for DuckDB CLI execution  
- 🔧 **Automation**: Master SQL script for pipeline orchestration  
- 📦 **Version Control**: Git/GitHub for versioned pipeline scripts  
- ☁️ **Storage**: Google Cloud Storage for source CSV files  

The pipeline transforms job posting CSVs from Google Cloud Storage into a normalized star schema data warehouse, then builds specialized analytical data marts. BI tools (Excel, Power BI, Tableau, Python) consume from both the warehouse and marts.

## 💻 Data Engineering Skills Demonstrated

### ETL Pipeline Development
- **Extract**: Direct CSV loading from Google Cloud Storage using DuckDB's httpfs extension  
- **Transform**: Data normalization, type conversion (`CAST`, `DATE_TRUNC`), and quality filtering  
- **Load**: Idempotent table creation with `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` patterns  
- **Incremental Updates**: `MERGE` operations for upsert patterns (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE in single statement)  
- **Orchestration**: Master SQL script (`build_dw_marts.sql`) for automated pipeline execution  

### Dimensional Modeling
- **Star Schema Design**: Fact table (`job_postings_fact`) with dimension tables (`company_dim`, `skills_dim`)  
- **Bridge Tables**: Many-to-many relationship handling (`skills_job_dim`, `bridge_company_location`, `bridge_job_title`)  
- **Grain Definition**: Proper fact table granularity (skill+month, company+title+location+month)  
- **Additive Measures**: Counts and sums that can be safely re-aggregated at any level  
- **Surrogate Keys**: Sequential ID generation using CTEs with self-joins (optional `company_mart` build only)  

### SQL Advanced Techniques
- **DDL Operations**: `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, `CREATE SCHEMA` for schema management  
- **DML Operations**: `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` with explicit column mapping from CSV sources  
- **MERGE Operations**: Incremental updates using `MERGE INTO` with `WHEN MATCHED`, `WHEN NOT MATCHED`, and `WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE` clauses for production-ready upsert patterns  
- **CTEs**: Common Table Expressions for complex transformations and boolean flag conversions  
- **Date Functions**: `DATE_TRUNC('month')`, `EXTRACT(quarter)` for temporal dimension creation  
- **String Functions**: `STRING_AGG` for concatenation, `REPLACE` for data cleaning  
- **Boolean Logic**: `CASE WHEN` conversions for aggregating flags (remote, health insurance, no degree)  

### Data Quality & Production Practices
- **Idempotency**: All scripts safely rerunnable without side effects  
- **Data Validation**: Verification queries at each pipeline step to ensure data integrity  
- **Type Safety**: Proper data type definitions (`VARCHAR`, `INTEGER`, `DOUBLE`, `BOOLEAN`, `TIMESTAMP`)  
- **Schema Organization**: Separate schemas (`flat_mart`, `skills_mart`, `priority_mart`, `company_mart`) for logical separation  
- **Error Handling**: Structured script execution with clear error messages and progress reporting
